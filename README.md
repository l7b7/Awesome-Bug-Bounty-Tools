massdns - A high-performance DNS resolver for bulk lookups, perfect for large-scale subdomain enumeration.


Findomain - One of the fastest cross-platform subdomain enumerators available, saving you valuable time during reconnaissance.


shuffledns - A wrapper for massdns that allows for bruteforcing, resolving, and handling wildcard subdomains effectively.


subfinder - A popular and reliable tool for discovering valid subdomains for websites using various online sources.


assetfinder - Quickly finds domains and subdomains related to a given target.


altdns - Generates and resolves permutations, alterations, and mutations of subdomains to discover hidden assets.

Port Scanning

masscan - An incredibly fast TCP port scanner that can scan the entire internet in minutes by sending asynchronous SYN packets.


RustScan - A modern and fast port scanner that finds open ports quickly and can automatically run Nmap scripts on them.


naabu - A fast and simple port scanner written in Go, focused on reliability and ease of use.


nmap - The industry-standard network mapper, essential for port scanning, service discovery, and vulnerability detection.

Screenshots & Visual Recon
